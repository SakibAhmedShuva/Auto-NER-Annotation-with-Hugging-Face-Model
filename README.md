# Auto NER Annotation with Hugging Face Model

An automated Named Entity Recognition (NER) annotation service that leverages Hugging Face transformer models to generate annotations for text data. This service is designed to streamline the NER annotation process by automatically identifying and labeling entities in text.

## üåü Features

- **Automated NER Processing**: Utilizes state-of-the-art Hugging Face transformer models for entity recognition
- **Flexible Input Handling**: Accepts both JSON file uploads and direct JSON data
- **Dynamic Model Loading**: Supports multiple models with automatic latest model selection
- **Structured Output**: Generates annotations in a standardized format compatible with common annotation tools
- **RESTful API**: Easy-to-use HTTP endpoint for inference
- **Model Management**: Support for multiple model versions with automatic latest model detection
- **Coming Soon**: Interactive frontend interface for visualization and annotation management

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Dependencies (specified versions):
  ```
  Flask==3.0.3
  transformers==4.45.2
  Werkzeug==3.0.4
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Auto-NER-Annotation-with-Hugging-Face-Model.git
cd Auto-NER-Annotation-with-Hugging-Face-Model
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up your models directory:
```bash
mkdir models
# Place your Hugging Face NER models in the models directory
```

## üìã Usage

### Starting the Server

Run the Flask application:
```bash
python app.py
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8000`

### API Endpoints

#### POST /inference

Submit text for NER annotation processing.

**Input Formats:**

1. JSON File Upload:
```json
{
    "Objects": [
        {
            "Text": "Your text content here"
        }
    ]
}
```

2. Direct JSON Request:
```json
{
    "Objects": [
        {
            "Text": "Your text content here"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Optional Parameters:**
- `model_path`: Specify a particular model version (defaults to latest)

**Example cURL Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/inference \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"Objects": [{"Text": "John works at Microsoft in Seattle"}]}'
```

### Output Format

The service returns annotations in the following structure:
```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "annotations": [
            {
                "completed_by": 1,
                "result": [
                    {
                        "value": {
                            "start": 0,
                            "end": 4,
                            "text": "John",
                            "labels": ["PERSON"]
                        },
                        "id": "label_uuid",
                        "from_name": "label",
                        "to_name": "text",
                        "type": "labels",
                        "origin": "manual"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "data": {
            "text": "John works at Microsoft in Seattle"
        }
    }
]
```
